# Alien Invasion game using pygame

I have finish up my first game using pygame.

The game is created following a python crash course 2nd edition by Eric Matthes!

I created an filepath.py which is not in the original source code because I wanted to specify filepath easily.

The high score.txt file stores the recorded high score and saves automatically. 

If you are not running the python default interpreter such as vs code or other text editor, please specify your file path in filepath.py.

### If you want to play this game.

1. Download it and put all code in one folder.

2. Go to filepath.py to specify the three file paths where you store it in your mac or pc.

3. Run the alien_invasion.py and enjoy!!!
